# Simple\_UI\_NoStorage

#### Description

This mod is my humble attempt at yet another UI mod.

This mod will work with Alpha 16.1 (b1) Stable, Alpha 16.2 (b7) Stable, Alpha 16.3 (b12) Stable, or Alpha 16.4 (b8) stable

This mod is and always will be pure xml edits only.

This mod adds some extra HUD bars and info to the UI as well as rework the toolbelt and increase player built storage, minibike storage, forge input, crafting queue, and all workstation outputs.

For a version with a bigger backpack try [Simple UI Plus](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?67506-Simple-UI-Plus)

Here's a list of some of the changes.

- Food and Water bars added to the bottom left HUD. (below health)
